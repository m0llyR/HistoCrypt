""" In cryptography, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) is a block cipher
    notable for its simplicity of description and implementation,
    typically a few lines of code. It was designed by David Wheeler and
    Roger Needham of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory; it was first presented
     at the Fast Software Encryption workshop in Leuven in 1994,
     and first published in the proceedings of that workshop.

    The cipher is not subject to any patents.
