    NSA algorithms
    Below is a non-exhaustive overview of (secret) encryption algorithms that have been developed by or for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and that are further described on this website. These algorithms are generally classed as an NSA Type 1 or Type 2 algorithm and are intended for governmental and military use. More a more complete overview, check out this page.

    BATON: Secret NSA Type 1 high-speed block cipher algorithm, used in several products, such as the Fortezza Plus crypto card and the Philips GCD-Φ cryptographic processor.
    HAVEQUICK: Frequency Hopping System used for ECCM. Implemented in the Cypris crypto chip.
    SAVILLE: Used for voice encryption in radio and telephone communication, in products like AIM, Cypris (SAVILLE I and II), Windster (SAVILLE I), INDICTOR (SAVILLE I), VINSON (KY-57), Spendex 40 and Cougar. Also used for data in the KG-84 Decicated Loop Encryption Device (DLED). Joint development of GCHQ (UK) and the NSA (USA). ➤ More
  * SKIPJACK: Block cipher algorithm used in products like Fortezza, Fortezza Plus and the Palladium Secure Modem. It was also used in the ill-fated Clipper Chip that was featured in products like the AT&T; TSD-3600 telephone encryptor. The Skipjack algorithm was declassified by the NSA on 24 June 1998. ➤ More
    WALBURN: High-speed link encryption that uses so-called hairpin registers. Used in products like KG-81, KG-94, KG-194, KG-95 and AIM (2004). Generally used for Trunk Encryption Devices (TED). ➤ More
